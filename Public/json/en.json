    "description": "There are corners that you don't look for, you find them. Padilla was just that: a revelation amidst the pasos and drums of Semana Santa. With the soul of a bodegón and the murmur of a kitchen that never shuts up, this was the origin of it all. This is where our first recipes and thousands of stories that still float in the air were born.",
    "description2":"The sun shines through the windows and bathes each table as if it were embracing us. Esquina Plaza Camas has opened its doors and with them, a new stage. Everything here is big: the light, the space, the desire. But it is also intimate, close, as if this corner had been waiting for us. Today, as always, we cook so that every visit feels like coming home.",
    "description3":"In the heart of Malaga there was a forgotten corner. Today it beats strongly. Esquina Granada is tapas, paellas, wine and joy. A place full of energy in the heart of the historic centre, where everything flows with its own rhythm, without ever losing the soul with which it was born.",

It was Holy Week—chaos and heart everywhere.\nA half-open kitchen, dishes flying out nonstop, people arriving without knowing what to expect… and staying.\nThat’s when we realized we weren’t just opening a restaurant: we were starting something bigger.\nPadilla wasn’t just the first. It was the place where everything we are today was born.",

And it never stopped.",
  
      "plaza_title": "The Big Step (Plaza Camas)",
      "plaza_text": "Plaza Camas was love at first sight.\nWe saw that bright corner and knew it had to be part of our story.\nToday it’s the largest in the group, with big windows and sunlight pouring into the kitchen.\nThis restaurant marked the moment we stopped being just an idea and became a real restaurant group.",
  
      "legado_title": "Our Legacy Is Cooked in Family",
      "legado_text": "Beyond walls, what defines us is how we do things.\nFrom the early days until now, we’ve grown from within.\nWaiters who became managers. Cooks who now lead kitchens.\nAnd teams that move between corners so the family spirit is felt everywhere.\nBecause if there’s one thing we want to leave behind, it’s this:\na way of working with joy, treating with care, and living hospitality as it deserves to be lived."
